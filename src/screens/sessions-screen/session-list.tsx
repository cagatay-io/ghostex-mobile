/**
 * The Sessions screen's list: the Unified list when the computer's sidebar setting asks for it, else the classic
 * project list. A switch between them mounts the other list, as it always has (each has its own key). Half folded
 * like a laptop (`components/common/foldGap.tsx`) the classic list runs across the fold, its rows continuing below
 * the fold's band; the Unified list ends above the fold, because each of its cards keeps its own swipe-open state,
 * which the copy below the band would keep separately.
